## Browser Compatibility

This app is targeted to run on Chrome (>= 36), Firefox (>= 45), and Opera (Blink).

## Getting Started

This repo only contains the web front-end part of Posty Poster project. It requires data from [posty-poster-data](https://github.com/ezhmd/posty-poster-data) repo, which contains design assets and templates. So, you need to clone both this repo and [posty-poster-data](https://github.com/ezhmd/posty-poster-data) repo.

```
$ mkdir posty-poster-project
$ cd posty-poster-project
$ git clone https://github.com/ezhmd/posty-poster.git
$ git clone https://github.com/ezhmd/posty-poster-data.git
```

If it's done correctly, the folder structure will look like this :

```
posty-poster-project
├── posty-poster            # Front end
└── posty-poster-data       # Data
```

Duplicate `config-sample.ts` inside `posty-poster-project/posty-poster/src` folder, configure it for your envirnoment, and rename it as `config.ts` (overwriting the existing `config.ts`).

Now, you need to build and run HTML server for both of them. This project includes gulp-connect as HTML server. 

The normal setup will run front-end server using port `60571` and data server using port `60572`. You can change these settings at vars section inside `gulpfile.js`. If you modify the data server port, you'll also need to modify `designDataApi` URL in `config.ts` file at the front-end part (`posty-poster/src/config.ts`).

Let's build and run the built in server.

```
$ cd ./posty-poster 
$ npm install
$ gulp build
$ cd ../posty-poster-data
$ npm install
$ gulp build
```

Then, open 2 different terminal tabs to create server. 

```
$ # Terminal 1
$ cd posty-poster-project/posty-poster
$ gulp connect
```
```
$ # Terminal 2
$ cd posty-poster-project/posty-poster-data
$ gulp connect
```

Open the site [http://localhost:60571/](http://localhost:60571/).
